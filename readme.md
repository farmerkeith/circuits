# Circuits

This repository is a place where I will be putting elementary circuit designs with simulated performance charts. 

The first item is a MOSFET diode with a control circuit made from discrete components. See the file MOSFETdiode.odt for the report. I intend to analyse control circuits using an operational amplifier and the special-purpose IC LTC4412.

The second item is a study of current shunt amplifier circuits, the first made from discrete components. See the file currenShuntAmplifier.odt for the report. I also intend to look at operational amplifiers, Hall effect devices and current splitting MOSFETs.
