# Circuits

This repository is a place where I will be putting elementary circuit designs with simulated performance charts. 

The first item is a MOSFET diode with a control circuit made from discrete components. See the file MOSFETdiode.odt for the report. I intend to analyse control circuits using an operational amplifier and the special-purpose IC LTC4412.

The second item is a study of current shunt amplifier circuits, the first made from discrete components. See the file currenShuntAmplifier.odt for the report so far. I also intend to look at operational amplifiers, Hall effect devices and current splitting MOSFETs. 

1 May 2018 Added another discrete component amplifier with emitter resistors that gives a greater current range and a more linear response especially for positive currents.

7 May 2018 Added more to the overview, and a spreadsheet analysis of the discrete component amplifier with emitter resistor. It enables better insight into the design sensitivities. Spice simulation required.
